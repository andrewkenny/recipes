        1, Use the largest mug you have to avoid it overflowing in the microwave!
        
        2, Add the flour, sugar and cocoa powder to the mug and mix.
        
        3, Add the egg to the mixture. Mix in as much as you can but don't worry if there's still dry mix left.
        
        4, Add all the other ingredients apart from the chocolate chips etc (if you are adding) and mix until smooth. 
        
        5, Add the chocolate chips and/or the nuts/raisins and mix well.
        
        6, Centre your mug in the middle of the microwave oven and cook on high for 4-5 mins, 
           or until it has stopped rising and is firm to the touch. Watch it rise as it cooks!
